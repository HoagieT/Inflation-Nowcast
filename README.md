# Inflation Nowcast
A dynamic factor model that forecasts inflation, i.e. CPI, PPI, in China

This code implements the nowcasting framework described in "[Macroeconomic Nowcasting and Forecasting with Big Data](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr830.html)" by Brandyn Bok, Daniele Caratelli, Domenico Giannone, Argia M. Sbordone, and Andrea Tambalotti, *Staff Reports 830*, Federal Reserve Bank of New York (prepared for Volume 10 of the *Annual Review of Economics*).

**Note:** The vintage example files (Vintage_CPI.py, Vintage_PPI.py) require installation of Wind Database and Wind Python API.
